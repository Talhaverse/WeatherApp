# Live Weather App

This Live Weather App, built using React Native and Expo, is designed to provide users with real-time weather information based on their location. Through this project, I aimed to expand my skills and knowledge in various areas of app development, including API integration, code optimization, best coding practices, props, navigation, state management, JSX, and more. Here's an overview of the key learning outcomes from this project:

## API Integration
Integrating an external API was a crucial aspect of this project. By connecting with a weather API, I successfully retrieved current weather data and upcoming forecasts. I gained a deep understanding of handling API requests, parsing JSON data, and utilizing the fetched information to display accurate weather updates.

## Code Optimization and Best Practices
Throughout the development process, I focused on optimizing the code for improved performance and readability. By implementing best coding practices, such as using functional components, hooks (like useState and useEffect), and proper componentization, I ensured a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

## ESLint Configuration
To maintain a consistent code style and adhere to industry standards, I integrated ESLint into my development environment. Configuring ESLint helped me detect and fix potential issues, ensuring a clean and standardized codebase. This enhances collaboration and simplifies maintenance.

## Navigation
Seamless navigation between different screens is essential for a smooth user experience. By implementing navigation techniques, I learned how to create intuitive user interfaces and enable effortless transitions within the app. This greatly enhances usability and engagement.

## Props and Componentization
Leveraging the power of props, I created reusable components that enhanced code modularity and reusability. Passing data and functions between components allowed for more efficient development and simplified state management.

## JSX and Dynamic UI
Learning how to effectively use JSX enabled me to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. By incorporating JSX into my development process, I designed visually appealing screens that provide an engaging experience for users.

I'm proud of the skills and knowledge I've gained through this project and I'm excited to apply them to future endeavors. Feel free to explore the code and use this app as a learning resource or starting point for your own projects.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start` or `npm start`.
4. Follow the instructions in the Expo DevTools to launch the app on a simulator or physical device.

Please note that this app requires location permissions to provide accurate weather information.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements. Happy coding!
